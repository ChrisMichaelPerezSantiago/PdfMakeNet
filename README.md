## Notes

This wrapper implements the same methods and options as pdfmake and will help you build pdfmake object structure more faster and easier using strong datatypes and some extension methods using c#.

Take note that this library as no server side render capabilities yet (Unless integration with NodeJs or any lib on c# that parses and executes javascript), so you still need to reference pdfmake.js and vfs_fonts.js files on your client or create your own pdfmake viewer for flawless integration.
